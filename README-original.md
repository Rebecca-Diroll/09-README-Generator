The purpose of this project is to create a README.md file generator. The code will prompt the user to answer a series of command line questions and then use the answers to fill in each section of a README.md file.

You will need to have node.js installed before using this program. [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Before running the code or installing npm dependencies, make sure that you have a `.gitignore` file with `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/`. This will prevent the `node_modules`directory from being tracked and uploaded to GitHub.

Begin with cloning the repository and open the repository directory file.

If you need to download the node_modules, run `npm i` in the terminal inside the cloned directory.

Next, run `node index.js` and answer the questions.

The answers to the questions will be used to create a README.md file and populate each section.
